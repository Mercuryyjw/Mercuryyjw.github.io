I am a first-year Ph.D. Student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.coe.miami.edu/index.html) at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/) with the supervision of Prof. [Mingzhe Chen](https://winslab.us/). I received M.Phil. in Computer and Information Engineering from The Chinese University of HongKong, Shenzhen in 2024, and B.Eng. in Telecommunication Engineering from Zhengzhou University in 2021.

**Research Interests:**

1. Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)/Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS),
1. Movable Antenna (MA)/Fluid Antenna System (FAS),
1. Integrated/Joint Sensing and Communication,
1. Optimization for wireless communication system.
